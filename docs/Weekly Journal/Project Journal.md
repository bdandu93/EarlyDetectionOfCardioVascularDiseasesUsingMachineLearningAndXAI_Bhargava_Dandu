# Journal.

This file contains weekly updates while developing this project.

## Week 1 (June 30 - July 5)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Reviewed the points outlined by the supervisor and external supervisor in the poster presentation.
- Challenges faced: the number of records present in the dataset are very less to implement machine learning models.
- Supervisor Feedback: External supervisor Dr. Abhishek Kaushik has suggested to merge the datasets to get more records to get meaningful results while implementing ML models.
- Next steps: Merging the Cleveland, Hungary, and Switzerland dataset and performing EDA on the combined dataset.


## Week 2 ( July 7 - July 11)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Merged the different countries datasets into a single dataset and performed EDA on the combined dataset.
- Challenges faced: There are a lot of missing values in the Switzerland dataset. The main challenge is to figure out a way to clean the combined dataset accordingly.
- Next steps: Cleaning the combined heart disease dataset and pre-processing the dataset for implementing ML techniques.


## Week 3 (July 13 - July 19)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have done the initial version of the data pre-processing for the combined dataset.
- Challenges faced: There are many missing records in the Switzerland dataset. We shall plan to use regression techniques to predict the missing values instead of dropping the records. 
- Next steps: We can implement the regression techniques and perform data pre processing.


## Week 4 (July 20 - July 26)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have perfromed the initial version of the data pre-processing by handling the NULL values.
- Challenges faced: The major challenge faced is to decide what method to choose to handle the NULL values and inappropriate values in the serum_cholestoral.
- Next steps: The next step is to handle the NULL values in the other columns as well.


## Week 5 (July 27 - Aug 2)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have implemented the ML model and evaluated the model.
- Challenge Faced: The  main challenge faced is to figure out which model we are implementing to predict the cardiovascular disease.
- Next steps: The next steps are to perfrom ML techniques like Cross validation, Hyperparameter tuning to improve the model performance.


## Week 6 (Aug 3 - Aug 9)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have implemented the ML model and further tuned the ML model by perfroming the cross validation.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge faced is preprocessing the data before implementing the ML model.
- Next steps: We got imiprovement in the model performance after performing cross validation. The next steps would be performing hyperparameter tuning and improving teh model performance.


## Week 7 (Aug 10 - Aug 16)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have further tuned the ML model by performing hyperparameter tuning and saw improvement in the evaluation metrics.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge faced while performing hyperparameter tuning is selecting the choice of the search strategy. 
- Next steps: The next steps are to futher implement ML techniques to enhance model performance and finally implement XAI techniques for explaining the model's predictions.


## Week 8 (Aug 17 - Aug 23)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Worked on creating an inital draft of the main report for the thesis.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge faced is to select the IEEE format research paper templat and including the components like tables and images into it.
- Next steps: We have created the base structure of the research paper and now we have to include all the components into the report.


## Week 9 (Aug 24 - Aug 30)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Finished the final draft of the thesis report. Worked on implementing the final version of the XAI techniques and model deployment.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge faced is integrating all the softwares and deployment in the mac os. The XAI techniques are very hard to implement and interpret. After analyzing the results there were few important features that contributed to the negative prediction. So, that means the newly created features are not completely explored. That was outlined in the future study.
- Next steps: The next steps are to submit the final draft of the artefact and wait for the supervisor feedback.


## Week 10 (Aug 31 - Sept 6)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We got the final corrections that has to be made on the final thesis report from our supervisor. We have made all the changes outlined by our supervisor.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge faced is to change the template of the report from research paper to the thesis report. We did an intense overleaf coding to rewrite the thesis report. We have also changed the final dashboard script to show few visualizations in the output. Instead of interactive dashboard with input/output we get to see the model performance and evaluation as well.
- Next steps: The next steps are to perform final corrections to the thesis report and do the final submission.

## Week 11 (Sept7 - Sept 13)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have made the final changes to the the dashboard.py script and created a interactive dashbaord which shows two seperate tabs. A tab that shows visual performance of the model and a tab that takes sample input and generates output accordingly.
- Challenge Faced: The major challenge is to change the entire template of final report from research paper template to the thesis report. We have added more visual content to elaborate the methodology of this project. We have added sample output of every output and given detailed interpretation for thesis report.
- Next steps: The further steps are to submit all the files related to our research, followed by final presentations and viva.
