# Journal.

This file contains weekly updates while developing this project.

## Week 1 (June 30 - July 5)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Reviewed the points outlined by the supervisor and external supervisor in the poster presentation.
- Challenges faced: the number of records present in the dataset are very less to implement machine learning models.
- Supervisor Feedback: External supervisor Dr. Abhishek Kaushik has suggested to merge the datasets to get more records to get meaningful results while implementing ML models.
- Next steps: Merging the Cleveland, Hungary, and Switzerland dataset and performing EDA on the combined dataset.


## Week 2 ( July 7 - July 11)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: Merged the different countries datasets into a single dataset and performed EDA on the combined dataset.
- Challenges faced: There are a lot of missing values in the Switzerland dataset. The main challenge is to figure out a way to clean the combined dataset accordingly.
- Next steps: Cleaning the combined heart disease dataset and pre-processing the dataset for implementing ML techniques.

## Week 3 (July 13 - July 19)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have done the initial version of the data pre-processing for the combined dataset.
- Challenges faced: There are many missing records in the Switzerland dataset. We shall plan to use regression techniques to predict the missing values instead of dropping the records. 
- Next steps: We can implement the regression techniques and perform data pre processing.

## Week 4 (July 20 - July 26)

Key Points:

- Progress Update: We have perfromed the initial version of the data pre-processing by handling the NULL values.
- Challenges faced: The major challenge faced is to decide what method to choose to handle the NULL values and inappropriate values in the serum_cholestoral.
- Next steps: The next step is to handle the NULL values in the other columns as well.
