# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease EDA & Prediction Project

This project focuses on combining, cleaning, and analyzing multiple Heart Disease datasets from Cleveland, Hungary, and Switzerland. 
The output is a cleaned dataset (heart_disease_combined.csv) and a series of exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations that help uncover key risk factors for heart disease.

## Installing dependencies
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```
## Installing requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Data Preparation and EDA
```
python3 scripts/EarlyCardioVascularDisease_EDA.py

python3 scripts/EarlyCardioVascularData_PreProcessing.py

```
This will 
- merge all the individual datasets into a single file.
- clean all the missing values and NaN values.
- Convert all the datatypes into
- It saves the final dataset into the combined_Dataset.csv
