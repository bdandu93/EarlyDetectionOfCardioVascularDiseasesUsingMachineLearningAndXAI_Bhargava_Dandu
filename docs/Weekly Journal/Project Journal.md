Key Points:

[] [Progress Update: Reviewed the points outlined by the supervisor and external supervisor in the poster presentation.]
[] challenges faced: the number of records present in the dataset are very less to implement machine learning models.
[] Supervisor Feedback: External supervisor Dr. Abhishek Kaushik has suggested to merge the datasets to get more records to get meaningful results while implementing ML models.
[] Next steps: Merging the Cleveland, Hungary, and Switzerland dataset and performing EDA on the combined dataset.
